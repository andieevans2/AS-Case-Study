# AS-Case-Study
R

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic form of arthritis which limits the motion of the spine
and muscles. This study was carried out at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in
Bath. The purpose of this designed experiment is to see if daily stretching of tissues around the
hip joints would help patients with AS to get more movement in their hip joints. In this designed
experiment, 12 patients were assigned to the control group, and 27 patients were assigned to the
treatment group. The client provided the raw data from the experiment and asked us to analyze
and provide answers to their research questions stated in section 1.1.

Set up of Data Collection:
Thirty-nine consecutive admitted patients with typical AS were allocated randomly to a control
group receiving the standard treatment or to the treatment group receiving additional stretching
exercises. The patients were assessed on admission and then three weeks after the experiment.
For each patient, their flexion and rotation were measured in degrees for both their left and right
hips, and an increase represents an improvement. The hip flexion is measured when patients lie
on their back with legs out straight on the ground and lift their one side knee and remain the other
side flat on the floor. The hip rotation is measured when patients sit and position their knees and
hips at 90 degrees. Then, without moving the hip, patients rotate their shanks using knees as the
pivot point.

Intended Use of the Results:
The result will be beneficial to the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases to improve on
their treatments to Ankylosing Spondylitis by stretching of tissues around the hip joints.
